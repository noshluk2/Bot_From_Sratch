## About this Repository
This is repository for the course **ROS Navigation Stack and SLAM for Autonomous Custom Robot** availble at Udemy . Complete source code is open sourced . Notes are also attached in root of the repository.

----
## Using this Repository
* Move into your workspace/src folder
 ```
 cd path/to/ros1_ws/src/
##e.g cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
  ```
* Clone the repository in your workspace
```
git clone https://github.com/noshluk2/ROS-Navigation-Stack-and-SLAM-for-Autonomous-Custom-Robot
```


* Perform make and build through catkin
 ```
 cd /path/to/workspace_root/
 ##e.g ~/catkin_ws/
 catkin_make
 ```
 
* Source your Workspace in any terminal you open to Run files from this workspace ( which is a basic thing of ROS )
```
source /path/to/catkin-ws/devel/setup.bash
```
- (Optional for Power USERs only) Add source to this workspace into bash file
 ```
echo "source /path/to/catkin-ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
 ```
  **NOTE:** This upper command is going to add the source file path into your ~/.bashrc file ( Only perform it once and you know what you are doing).This will save your time when running things from the Workspace

## Course Workflow
- We will start by creating a custom robot named as Explorer Bot .Two wheel Differential Drive type , created from scratch using URDF containing joints, links are which are going to be explored in depth. Once the robot will be created we will add Gazebo Plugins into it  ( Differential Drive and Laser Scanner ) into URDF of our robot  . This will lead us to driving the robot and reading laser scan values from inside of simulation.

- After understanding all the basics of with a Custom mobile Robot we will move to a very well known ROS package SLAM  which contains multiple nodes for mapping a environment , we will utilize Gmapping Node with lidar sensor as a source . Then we will bring in a 3D mesh of a pipeline of which we create a map.

- After that we will create a room for Autonomous Navigation using Gazebo Model Builder tool. Out robot will perform Autonomous driving using Navigation Stack and Path Planning algorithms from Navigation Stack .
